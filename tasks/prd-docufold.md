## DocuFold Extension for VSCode/Cursor

### Introduction/Overview

DocuFold is a VSCode/Cursor extension designed to automatically fold and manage docstrings in source code files to improve code readability and developer focus. The extension addresses the common problem where extensive docstrings, while valuable for documentation, can clutter the code view and distract developers from focusing on the actual business logic.

**Problem Statement**: Developers often feel overwhelmed by lengthy docstrings in their codebase, especially when reviewing or writing code. These docstrings, while necessary for documentation, can make it difficult to focus on the core logic and flow of the code.

**Goal**: Create an intelligent extension that automatically manages docstring visibility, allowing developers to maintain clean, focused code views while preserving easy access to documentation when needed.

### Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Automatically fold docstrings across multiple programming languages to create cleaner code views
2. **Usability Goal**: Provide flexible control options allowing developers to customize folding behavior according to their workflow
3. **Performance Goal**: Maintain responsive performance even with large files (5000+ lines)
4. **Compatibility Goal**: Support multiple programming languages that use docstrings or documentation comments
5. **User Experience Goal**: Provide intuitive visual indicators and preview functionality for folded docstrings

### User Stories

**As a Python developer**, I want docstrings to be automatically folded when I open a file, so that I can focus on the code logic without visual distraction.

**As a multi-language developer**, I want the extension to work consistently across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and other languages, so that I have a uniform experience regardless of the technology stack.

**As a code reviewer**, I want to quickly toggle between viewing and hiding docstrings, so that I can focus on logic during review but access documentation when needed.

**As a team lead**, I want to configure the extension at workspace level with specific file patterns, so that the team has consistent documentation folding behavior.

**As a developer working with large codebases**, I want the extension to perform efficiently on files with thousands of lines, so that my editor remains responsive.

**As a new team member**, I want to see brief previews of folded docstrings, so that I can quickly understand what each function does without fully expanding the documentation.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Auto-folding Capability**: The extension must automatically fold docstrings when a file is first opened
2. **Multi-language Support**: The extension must support docstring folding for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, PHP, and other languages with documentation comment conventions
3. **Manual Control**: The extension must provide commands to manually fold/unfold individual docstrings or all docstrings in a file
4. **Toggle Mode**: The extension must include a toggle to enable/disable automatic folding functionality
5. **Preview Display**: The extension must show a brief preview (first line or summary) of folded docstrings
6. **Command Palette Integration**: The extension must provide commands accessible via VSCode's command palette:
   - "DocuFold: Toggle Auto-fold"
   - "DocuFold: Fold All Docstrings"
   - "DocuFold: Unfold All Docstrings"
   - "DocuFold: Fold Current Docstring"
   - "DocuFold: Unfold Current Docstring"
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: The extension must provide customizable keyboard shortcuts for common actions
8. **Status Bar Integration**: The extension must display current folding status in VSCode's status bar
9. **Settings Configuration**: The extension must provide workspace and user-level settings for:
   - Enable/disable auto-folding
   - File pattern inclusion/exclusion
   - Preview text length
   - Language-specific behavior
10. **Docstring Detection**: The extension must accurately detect various docstring formats:
    - Python: triple quotes (""" and '''), single line docstrings
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc comments (/\*\* \*/)
    - Java/C#: XML documentation comments (/// or /\*\* \*/)
    - Other language-specific documentation patterns
11. **Folding API Integration**: The extension must utilize VSCode's existing folding API for consistent behavior with editor features
12. **Performance Optimization**: The extension must handle large files efficiently without causing editor lag
13. **File Pattern Filtering**: The extension must allow users to specify which file types or patterns should have auto-folding enabled

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Docstring Generation**: The extension will not generate or modify docstring content
2. **Docstring Validation**: The extension will not validate docstring format or completeness
3. **Code Analysis**: The extension will not analyze code quality or suggest improvements
4. **Syntax Highlighting**: The extension will not modify existing syntax highlighting for docstrings
5. **Version Control Integration**: The extension will not interact with git or other version control systems
6. **Multi-cursor Editing**: Advanced multi-cursor operations on docstrings are out of scope for v1
7. **Live Collaboration**: Real-time folding synchronization across collaborative editing sessions

### Design Considerations

**Visual Design**:

- Folded docstrings should display a concise preview (e.g., "Brief description..." with ellipsis)
- Use consistent folding markers that align with VSCode's native folding UI
- Status bar indicator should be subtle but informative (e.g., "DocuFold: ON")

**User Interface**:

- Settings should be organized in a logical hierarchy under "DocuFold" extension settings
- Command palette entries should use clear, descriptive names
- Keyboard shortcuts should follow VSCode conventions and avoid conflicts

**Interaction Design**:

- Clicking on folded docstring should expand it
- Hover over folded docstring should show tooltip with longer preview
- Context menu integration for fold/unfold actions

### Technical Considerations

**VSCode API Integration**:

- Utilize `vscode.languages.registerFoldingRangeProvider` for consistent folding behavior
- Leverage `vscode.TextEditorDecorationType` for custom visual indicators
- Use `vscode.workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument` for auto-folding functionality

**Performance Considerations**:

- Implement debounced text analysis to avoid excessive computation
- Use incremental parsing for large files
- Cache folding ranges to improve subsequent operations

**Language Detection**:

- Use VSCode's language detection system (`document.languageId`)
- Implement language-specific regex patterns for docstring detection
- Provide extensible architecture for adding new language support

**Extension Dependencies**:

- Should integrate with existing VSCode folding mechanisms
- Must not conflict with other folding extensions
- Should respect user's existing folding preferences

### Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: 80% of team members actively use the extension within 2 weeks of introduction
2. **Performance Metric**: File opening time increases by no more than 10% even with auto-folding enabled
3. **User Satisfaction**: Average rating of 4+ stars on VSCode marketplace
4. **Usage Patterns**: 70% of users utilize both auto-folding and manual control features
5. **Error Rate**: Less than 1% of docstrings incorrectly identified or folded
6. **File Size Support**: Successfully handles files up to 10,000 lines without performance degradation

### Open Questions

1. **Language Priority**: Which languages should be implemented first beyond Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript?
2. **Preview Length**: What is the optimal character limit for docstring previews (current thinking: 50-80 characters)?
3. **Default Behavior**: Should auto-folding be enabled by default for new installations?
4. **Nested Docstrings**: How should the extension handle docstrings within nested functions or classes?
5. **Integration Testing**: What existing VSCode extensions should be tested for compatibility?
6. **Accessibility**: Are there specific accessibility considerations for screen readers when docstrings are folded?
7. **Marketplace Publishing**: What are the requirements and process for publishing to VSCode marketplace?
